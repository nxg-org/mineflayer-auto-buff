# Notice: WIP

This plugin provides functionality mineflayer bots related to applying potion effects to entities.
As I want to make it support later versions without hard-coding, I am basing its search for potions off of minecraft-data.
However, minecraft is gay and does not name the potions with the same effect as it applies (I.E. speed, swiftness).
I have not decided whether I should write some edge-case bullshit that parses data for strength and type of potions or hardcode values.

If anyone wishes to contribute, feel free to let me know.
This will be updated in a few days, so go ahead and use this plugin for regeneration, strength, etc.
